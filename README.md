My final project ITDEV 161. A website for Splatoon 2.

Working off of a project I played with over the summer, this is a website that has some references and resources for the Nintento Switch game Splatoon 2.

Building off my [last project for VICOM 128](https://github.com/progdawn/progdawn.github.io), I will create the site using Angular 2.
