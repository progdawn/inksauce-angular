       "Description": "Burst Bombs are spherical balloons filled with ink that explode on contact. They use less ink than Splat Bombs, and Suction Bombs, and therefore cause less damage.",

       "AltText": "Curling Bomb",
       "Description": "When deployed, the Curling Bomb travels in a straight line across the floor, leaving a trail of Ink and bouncing off of any wall or obstacle it encounters. It explodes after it has traveled its maximum distance. The maximum distance of the Curling Bomb may be shortened by charging, or 'cooking' it with R before release.",

       "AltText": "Autobomb",
       "Description": "Autobombs are comparable to S Weapon Sub Seekers from Splatoon. Unlike the Seeker however, they do not leave a trail of ink and can freely change direction. Once thrown, the Autobomb will seek out any enemy players in the vicinity, indicated by the circle which appears once the autobomb has landed, and will automatically move towards them for quite a long time. Once the Autobomb reaches a player or travels far enough without reaching the player, it will explode. If thrown and no enemies are in range, the Autobomb will automatically explode where it was thrown, similar to a S2 Weapon Sub Splat Bomb.",

       "Description": "Suction Bombs can be thrown and are able to attach to virtually any surface, including walls and ceilings. After two seconds, they explode in a burst of ink. Throwing a Suction Bomb will use up 70% of player's Ink Tank under normal circumstances, just like the Splat Bomb. They will also immediately explode upon contact with the Rainmaker's shield or a Splash Wall.",

A Beakon is destroyed when the Super Jumping Inkling lands or when it is damaged by an enemy. One Inkling using Beakons can have up to three placed in the stage at one time; attempting to create a fourth will destroy the oldest of those currently active.",

When thrown, they explode in a spherical cloud that has the color of the player's ink and tag any enemy Inkling in a certain range with a swirling squid marker. This marker allows tagged enemies to be seen through barriers by all teammates, allowing them to be easily tracked.",

Opponents will instantly get splattered if they attempt to walk through the Splash Wall, but the player who spawned it and their teammates will have no effect. These players will also be able to shoot through the wall. A similar weapon is also used by the Octarians in Octo Valley.",

Ink Mines do not detonate on their own, so they will remain on the battlefield until triggered. Each Ink Mine uses 60% of the ink tank's capacity. It deals 35 damage to opponents caught directly in the blast, and 20 damage to those near the blast.",
