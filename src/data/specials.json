       "Alt Text": "Baller",
       "Description": "When using the special move, an Inkling will enter the Baller. This allows them to move quickly and take less damage while inking the ground as they move, and also allows them to walk up walls. If ZR is held while in the bubble, or after a set period of time, the Baller explodes, covering the surrounding area in ink. The Baller being inked results in it shrinking, eventually disappearing, instead of the Inkling using it taking damage.",

       "Description": "The Bubble Blower allows players to create three large bubbles. The bubbles slowly move and bounce in the direction the player fired them. As the bubbles move, they grow when hit by the user's ink and shrink when hit by the opposing team's ink. If the player or their team pops the bubble, a lethal blast of ink splats any enemy close to the bubble and inks the area. If too much time passes without a bubble being popped, or if the enemy pops one, it will fizzle away without a deadly blast of ink.",

       "Description": "The Ink Armor is a special weapon from Splatoon 2 that functions similarly to the Bubbler special weapon, negating up to 30 points of damage before it breaks. The player can still attack with their main weapon and sub weapon when Ink Armor is activated. Unlike the Bubbler, the Ink Armor's effect is applied to all team members when activated, no matter the distance from the activator to the teammate, and is not susceptible to knockback from enemy fire. The Ink Armor's effect ends for a player when the duration of the special expires or more than 30 damage is taken in total, and will immediately begin to receive damage as usual.",

The jet will also leave a trail of ink which comes out of the jet's exhaust which can also splat enemy players. While the player is mid-air, they can switch to inkling form to easily dodge sniper shots and confuse enemy players. When the special is finished, the player will Super Jump back to the location where they activated the Inkjet. Be aware that the Inkjet's landing marker will be visible to all players, much like a Super Jump marker. Unlike other specials, if the player falls off the map, the player will super jump back to the location where they activated the Inkjet and the special will end.",

Using it on the ground will cause the player to jump up with a short delay, but it can also be used from the air or during a Super Jump. A player using Splashdown is briefly vulnerable to attacks. Similar to S2 Weapon Special Ink Armor, the player can be splatted before the activation animation is finished. The weapon is more effective in the air, while the Inkling is Super Jumping. A radius displays when the Splashdown is used; this radius indicates the weapon's one-hit-splat range. Opponents just outside this area will still take significant damage.",

When not firing, the player can see silhouettes of opponents on the map. The player can then continue firing.",
